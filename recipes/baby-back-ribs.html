            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>These baby back ribs cooked in a crockpot are the best I've had, short of the actual grilling method of course! This is a very simple recipe that I came up with a few years ago. It's not rocket science, just ribs cooked in the slow cooker and finished with barbeque sauce in the oven. This is what I do when I want ribs during the week and have to work all day. I'm eating them within 30 minutes of getting home, and they turn out perfect every time!</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 pounds baby back ribs, trimmed</li>
                    <li>salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                    <li>Â½ onion, sliced</li>
                    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 (18 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce</li>
                </ul>  
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Season ribs with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Pour 1/2 cup water into the slow cooker, then add ribs. Scatter onion and garlic over top.</li> 
                    <li>Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours or High for 4 hours.</li>
                    <li>When the ribs are almost finished, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Transfer ribs from the slow cooker to a baking sheet and coat with barbeque sauce. Discard onion and garlic.</li>
                    <li>Bake ribs in the preheated oven until sauce caramelizes and sticks to meat, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
