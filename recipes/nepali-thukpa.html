            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Thukpa has so many different versions, but the main things are usually the same: oil, garlic, spices, noodles, veggies and fresh herbs. I made my own version and we loved it! It's a little spicy (but not too much) and it has veggies, mushrooms and a bunch of garlic and herbs. The best part is that you don't need any kind of store-bought broth. Because when you cook spices, onion and garlic in oil and then simmer them with veggies and mushrooms, you will have a wonderful natural broth. Just add enough salt and there will be a ton of taste!</p>
                <p>Thukpa usually has cabbage or spinach in it, so I decided to go with spinach this time. Actually, this recipe is pretty universal. You can always add green peas or other legumes. You can also swap or add some veggies. Bell pepper is often used in this, but I'm not a fan of it. I do love fresh cilantro and I used a load of it. If you're not feeling the cilantro, you can replace it with fresh parsley. You can also leave out the mushrooms, if you want. But if possible, I strongly recommend to stick to the recipe, because it's worth it.</p>
                <p>When I make soups, I usually boil everything in the same pot. But with thukpa, you need to boil the noodles ahead and add them in the end. That way the broth will not be starchy and mushy. I used rice noodles but you can use any kind of noodles. The soup will be nicely thick and hearty, too. I recommend to chop the veggies and boil the water before you start making the soup. It will be much easier that way. Happy cooking and slurping!</p>
